# Improved Multiscale Networks and Collaborative Edge Computing for Precise and Real-Time Tool Fault Diagnosis in Industrial IoT
## Abstract
With the ongoing evolution of smart manufacturing, achieving high-precision and real-time tool condition monitoring has become increasingly crucial for ensuring manufacturing quality, operational efficiency, and system reliability. To address this pressing demand, this study proposes a novel tool fault diagnosis approach that integrates deep learning with cooperative edge computing. The main contributions are twofold. First, an Improved Multiscale Network (IMSNet) is developed, which synergistically combines multiscale convolutional layers, long short-term memory (LSTM) units, and a multi-head attention mechanism to effectively capture and fuse spatial–temporal dependencies of cutting signals under diverse operating conditions. This design significantly enhances the model’s capability to accurately identify complex tool wear patterns. Second, a Cloud–Edge–Device Collaboration (CEDC) framework is designed to meet stringent industrial real-time requirements. By dynamically allocating computational tasks and establishing a robust collaboration mechanism across the cloud, edge, and device layers, the CEDC framework substantially improves the responsiveness and scalability of tool fault diagnosis. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IMSNet achieves a diagnostic accuracy of 98.13%, while the CEDC framework reduces task offloading latency by 17.6%, validating the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method in intelligent manufacturing environments.
